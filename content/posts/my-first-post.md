Hello everyone !


I am a student at Télécom SudParis and at the Institut Polytechnique de Paris (IPP).
This year (2020) I am following the master Virtual and Augmented Reality at the IPP.

I created this blog for my Human Computer Interaction (HCI) class. 
You will find here 4 of my lectures' homework respectively about : human perception, HCI researchers, the design process and Ubiquitous Computing. 
You can also find the description of 4 of my HCI laboratories where I created two simple Unity games on dekstop, then how I transsposed one of them on android, and finally how I put it in virtual reality.


Have fun !
