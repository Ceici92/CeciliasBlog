Hello everyone !

I am a student at Telecom SudParis since 2018, where I learned the basics of Extended Reality, how to use Unity, and how to code on various languages such as Java and C.
I really liked my classes of Extended Reality, so I decided to join a master dedicated to it.
This year (2020), I am following the master Virtual and Augmented Reality at the Institut Polytechnique de Paris (IPP), as a double degree with Telecom SudParis.

I created this blog for my Human Computer Interaction (HCI) class. 
You will find here 4 of my lectures' homework respectively about : human perception, HCI researchers, the design process, and Ubiquitous Computing. 
You can also find the description of 4 of my HCI laboratories, where I created : two simple Unity games on dekstop, transposed one of them on android, and put it in virtual reality.


Have fun !
