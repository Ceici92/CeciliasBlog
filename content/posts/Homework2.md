## The Ultimate Display form Evan E. Sutherland

In this paper, Evan Sutherland points out the interesting 1960s' displays, which will be developed in the future. On top of that, he even predicts new displays that we use today. 

First, he reminds us about the importance of a display: understand digital computers as we understand the laws in a physical world. 

Then, from the displays used in his area, he guesses the ones that will be mainly used in the future : the keyboards, the "area filling" ability, the stylus and its drag and drop ability, the knobs and the joysticks.

He even successes in predicting human computer interactions that did not exist in the 1960s. For example, he figures out that not only the arm and the hand can be useful, but also all the rest of our body. This reflexion is what led us to the Kinect technology 50 years after.

Besides, he also predicts the modelling of objects that do not have realistic properties, or the modelling of the ones that we do not fully understand. 

At the end, the author talks about an ability that our computers still do not have: create matter or the sensation of it. Today, we have 3D printers that can create a new object of matter. Furthermore, we have virtual reality that can visually create a world in front of the player eyes. 

However, the 3D printers are still not fast enough to create a chair in front of the user as fast as he imagines it, and there is still no democratised haptic feedback in virtual reality that could give the player the sensation to sit on a real chair for example.

On another part, Evan Sutherland dreams of the control of computer through vision. Current technologies enable us to identify where the user is looking, it is for example used for user detection to unblock a computer, or to identify a user. However, even if some companies took the risk to use the eyes' glance as "mouse", it is uncomfortable for the player. Thus, even if current technologies enable it, it may be let aside in our future.
