## The Ultimate Display form Evan E. Sutherland

In this paper, Evan Sutherland points out the intersting 1960s' displays that will be developped in the futur, and he even predicts new displays that we use today. 
First, he reminds us the the importance of a display : understand digital computers as we understand the laws in a physical world. 
Then, from the displays used in his area, he guesses the ones that will be mainly used in the futur : the keyboards, the "area filling" ability, the stylus and its drag and drop ability, the knobs and the joysticks.
He even successes in predicting human commputer interactions that did not exist in the 1960s. For exemple, he figured out that not only the arm and the hand can be usefull, but also all the rest of our body. This reflexion is what led us to the kinect technology 50 years after.
Besides, he also predicts the modelisation of objects that do not have realistic properties, or with ones that we do not fully understand. 
At the end, the author talks about an ability that our computers still do not have : create matter or the sensation of it. Today, we have 3D printers that can rapidly create a new object of matter. Furthemore, we have virtual reality that can visually create a worl in front of the player eyes. 
However, the 3D printers are still not fast enough to create a chair in front of the user so fast, and there is still no democratised haptic feedback in virtual reality that could guive the player the sensation to sit on a chair for exemple.
On a other part, Evan Sutherland imagine the control of computer through vision. Current technologies enable us to identify where the user is looking, even if it is not always precise, however it seems complicated to control a computer through it, this
