Hello everyone ! 

In today's lesseon I learned more about the design process, sketching, prototyping and user evaluation.


# Ideate

I thought of 3 ideas of augmented reality applications to enhance human abilities. 


## Telepathy

Didn't you ever want to know what the others think ? Well with this AR application you could ! 

Indeed, this first application enables telepathy. 
The user has the possibility to choose to hear the thoughts of everyone in a 3 metters perimeter, to hear only the positive toughts, or only hear the thoughts of one person. 
Here are some sketches of what would see the user with the application. 

On the top right you can see a little icon, the user can select it to see the 3 different options he as.
He can decide to only see the positive thoughts around him, to only see the thaughts of one person, or to see everyone thaughts.

Once the user chose one option, the little icon on the top right corresponds to the option selected.

Here is the firsts sketches in the point of you of the user.
He is in a family dinner with his parents in law. 
He chooses to only heat the positive thaughts.

*Dinner with the parents in law*

Below you can see an exemple of the option " 1 person thaughts ". 
Here he discovers if his friends really liked his gift.

*Did he really liked my gift*

The last option is to see everyone's thaughts in a 3 metters perimeter. 
I here you say, "Why would we want to know all their thaugts ?".
Well, because you are bored in the subway !

## Super Jumps

The second idea is to enhance human jumping, with an application that gives the sensation to jump higther. 
First, the user can choose how hight he wants to jump, then he can see the creation of a virtual hole in front of him, where he will jump into.
Even if he lands faster than what he sees in the headset, the image will give him the sensation that he is still falling.

Below you can see a sketch that shows the user's menu, where he can choose to jump to 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10 metters. 
Jumping 2 metters is possible for humans, but quite difficult. 
I believe that the human record is 2,78 metters, so 4 metters is really impressive.

As we can see, instead of tracking his hands, the setup tracks the user's feats. It guives more realism to the jump.


## Piano Virtuose

The third idea is a AR application that helps the user becoming a pianist. 
As you can see on the sketch below, the player wears an AR headset that hilights in color the key that should be played next, on the music sheet and on the keyboard.

The color hilighting the key depends on the note's length. 
The shortest beat a note is, the more vivid the color will be. 
For exemple, on the sketch I chose to hilight in blue a minim note (2 beats), and in red a demisemiquaver (1/8 beat).
The semibreves could be highlighted in green, the minims in blue, the crotchets in purple, the quaver in yellow, the semiquaver in orange and the demisemiquaver in red.

This way, the AR application would not only show which piano key to play, but how long it should be played.


# Prototype

I decided to make a prototype of the piano application, because it seemed to be the most feasible.

I think that a paper prototype is really suited for this application. 
My idea was to represent piano keys on the paper, by cutting holes on a first sheet and putting on top of a second sheet.
To let another piece of paper in color pass through the two sheets, they should only be glued on their extremities.

To make my prototype a minimum realistic, I started by measuring the size of the piano keys, before drawing them on the first paper sheet.
I let a little space between each key to make them reacognizable once cut.

Then, I cut the paper following the guidelines I draw.

Next, I glued the first sheet of paper on the second one, but I let space on top of the keys.
Because it is easier to control the color sheet from the side the most futher away from the key, without troubling the player.
I added the black keys for realism, but without making them playable since some songs can be played only with the white keys.

Finally, I cut two long paper sheet of the width of one key notes, in order to simulate the hilighting of the application.
My prototype was now ready to use !
