Hello everyone ! 

In today's lesseon I learned more about the design process, sketching, prototyping and user evaluation.

I thought of 3 ideas of augmented reality applications to enhance human abilities. 

The first one is an AR application enabling telepathy, with the possibility to choose to hear the thoughts of everyone in a 3 metters perimeter, to hear only the positive toughts, or only hear the thoughts of one person. 


The second iddea is to enhance human jumping, with an application that guive the sensation to jump higther. You can choose between 

# Ideate

# Prototype

# User Evaluation
