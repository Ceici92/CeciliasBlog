Hello everyone !

After creating my blog, it is time to write my first Human Computer Interaction's assignment.

## Affordances

As I saw in class, an affordance is a property of an artefact which indicates its usage. 

To illustrate this concept, I chose to talk about my vacuum cleaner. Its handle is well done. Automatically through its form, we know how to use the vacuum.

On the contrary, a bad affordance leads us to an incorrect usage of an object. 

For example, the hotplate of my apartment becomes red when its temperature is increasing, and not just because it is on. As a result, when I start cooking it becomes red, but during the cooking it is black again. 
Therefore, the first few times I forgot to turn it off, because instinctively if I did not see red I thought it was not hot, and thus turned off.

## Gestalt Laws

Gestalt Laws are principles of perception describing how humans recognize patterns or interpret an association of objects around them. 


## Dark Design Pattens

Dark designs aim to advantage a business by using humans' cognition to trick the user.

For example, Instagram uses the principle of "Obstruction" and "Interference" to discourage a user to delete his account. 
Indeed, we would think that we only need to go to our account parameters to delete it, but instead we only have the possibility to "Deactivate it temporarily". This functionality is an Interference to prevent us from deleting our account. 
To delete our account, we have to go to the Instagram website (not on the application) and go to the support page, without being connected ! This is Obstruction because this process is more difficult than it had to be.

Amazon Prime Video uses the Sneaking technique, to make us buy a movie or episodes of a tv-show. For example, the site presents us the TV Show "Watchmen" as one of the programs available on the site. When we click on it, we even have the same presentation as an available show.
However, when we click on the "Plus d'options d'achats" which really looks like "Ajouter aux favoris", we finally see that we must pay to watch it.
