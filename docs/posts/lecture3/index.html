<p>In today&rsquo;s lesson I learned more about the design process, sketching, prototyping and user evaluation.</p>
<h1 id="ideate">Ideate</h1>
<p>I thought of 3 ideas of augmented reality applications to enhance human abilities.</p>
<h2 id="telepathy">Telepathy</h2>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t you ever want to know what the others think ? Well with this AR application you could !</p>
<p>Indeed, this first application enables telepathy.
The user has the possibility to choose to hear the thoughts of everyone in a 3 meters perimeter, to hear only the positive thoughts, or only hear the thoughts of one person.
Here are some sketches of what would see the user with the application.</p>
<p>On the top right you can see a little icon, the user can select it to see the 3 different options he as.
He can decide to only see the positive thoughts around him, to only see the thoughts of one person, or to see everyone thoughts.</p>
<p>Once the user chose one option, the little icon on the top right corresponds to the option selected.</p>
<p>Here is the firsts sketches in the point of you of the user.
He is in a family dinner with his parents in law.
He chooses to only heat the positive thoughts.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/Ceici92/HugoBlog/blob/master/docs/images/Lecture3/Telepathy1.jpg?raw=true" alt="alt Text" title="First sketch"></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/Ceici92/HugoBlog/blob/master/docs/images/Lecture3/Telepathy2bis.jpg?raw=true" alt="alt Text" title="Dinner with the parents in law">
<em>Dinner with the parents in law</em></p>
<p>Below you can see an example of the option &quot; 1 person thoughts &ldquo;.
Here he discovers if his friends really liked his gift.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/Ceici92/HugoBlog/blob/master/docs/images/Lecture3/Telepathy4.jpg?raw=true" alt="alt Text" title="Did he really liked my gift">
<em>Did he really like my gift</em></p>
<p>The last option is to see everyone&rsquo;s thoughts in a 3 meters perimeter.
I here you say, &ldquo;Why would we want to know all their thougts ?&rdquo;.
Well, because you are bored in the subway !</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/Ceici92/HugoBlog/blob/master/docs/images/Lecture3/Telepathy2.jpg?raw=true" alt="alt Text" title="When you are bored in the subway">
<em>When you are bored in the subway</em></p>
<h2 id="super-jumps">Super Jumps</h2>
<p>The second idea is to enhance human jumping, with an application that gives the sensation to jump higher.
First, the user can choose how hight he wants to jump, then he can see the creation of a virtual hole in front of him, where he will jump into.
Even if he lands faster than what he sees in the headset, the image will give him the sensation that he is still falling.</p>
<p>Below you can see a sketch that shows the user&rsquo;s menu, where he can choose to jump to 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10 meters.
Jumping 2 meters is possible for humans, but quite difficult.
I believe that the human record is 2,78 meters, so 4 meters is really impressive.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/Ceici92/HugoBlog/blob/master/docs/images/Lecture3/Jump1.jpg?raw=true" alt="alt Text" title="Jump1"></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/Ceici92/HugoBlog/blob/master/docs/images/Lecture3/Jump2.jpg?raw=true" alt="alt Text" title="Jump2"></p>
<p>As we can see, instead of tracking his hands, the setup tracks the user&rsquo;s feats. It gives more realism to the jump.</p>
<h2 id="piano-virtuoso">Piano Virtuoso</h2>
<p>The third idea is a AR application that helps the user becoming a pianist.
As you can see on the sketch below, the player wears an AR headset that highlights in colour the key that should be played next, on the music sheet and on the keyboard.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/Ceici92/HugoBlog/blob/master/docs/images/Lecture3/Piano1.jpg?raw=true" alt="alt Text" title="Piano sketch"></p>
<p>The colour highlighting the key depends on the note&rsquo;s length.
The shortest beat a note is, the more vivid the colour will be.
For example, on the sketch I chose to highlight in blue a minim note (2 beats), and in red a demisemiquaver (1/8 beat).
The semibreves could be highlighted in green, the minims in blue, the crotchets in purple, the quaver in yellow, the semiquaver in orange and the demisemiquaver in red.</p>
<p>This way, the AR application would not only show which piano key to play, but how long it should be played.</p>
<h1 id="prototype">Prototype</h1>
<p>I decided to make a prototype of the piano application, because it seemed to be the most feasible.</p>
<p>I think that a paper prototype is really suited for this application.
My idea was to represent piano keys on the paper, by cutting holes on a first sheet and putting on top of a second sheet.
To let another piece of paper in colour pass through the two sheets, they should only be glued on their extremities.</p>
<p>To make my prototype a minimum realistic, I started by measuring the size of the piano keys, before drawing them on the first paper sheet.
I let a little space between each key to make them recognizable once cut.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/Ceici92/HugoBlog/blob/master/docs/images/Lecture3/Piano2.jpg?raw=true" alt="alt Text" title="Piano drawing"></p>
<p>Then, I cut the paper following the guidelines I draw.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/Ceici92/HugoBlog/blob/master/docs/images/Lecture3/Piano3.jpg?raw=true" alt="alt Text" title="Paper cut and black keys"></p>
<p>Next, I glued the first sheet of paper on the second one, but I let space on top of the keys.
Because it is easier to control the colour sheet from the side the most further away from the key, without troubling the player.
I added the black keys for realism, but without making them playable since some songs can be played only with the white keys.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/Ceici92/HugoBlog/blob/master/docs/images/Lecture3/Piano4.jpg?raw=true" alt="alt Text" title="Papers joined"></p>
<p>Finally, I cut two long paper sheets of the width of one key notes, in order to simulate the highlighting of the application.
My prototype was now ready to use !</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/Ceici92/HugoBlog/blob/master/docs/images/Lecture3/Piano5.jpg?raw=true" alt="alt Text" title="Prototype"></p>
