      <description>Hello everyone !
Lab 1 Part a: Setup Blog It is my first blog, and my first time using a static site generator. For simplicity, I chose to use the one advised by my teachers : Hugo.
I started following the slides from this lab, and I created this site.
Then I added the gitignore (just an empty .txt file, because first I used an example from an Hugo site but it gave me a hard time during deployment).</description>

      <description>Hello everyone !
After creating my blog, it is time to write my first Human Computer Interaction&amp;rsquo;s assignment.
Affordances As I saw in class, an affordance is a property of an artefact which indicates its usage. To illustrate this concept, I chose to talk about my vacuum cleaner. Its handle is well done. Automatically through its form, we know how to use the vacuum.
On the contrary, a bad affordance leads us to an incorrect usage of an object.</description>
